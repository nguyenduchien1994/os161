1. While working on this project, I learned a lot more about OS161 user/kernel space and process subsystems. I also learn how to use the debugger gdb system more efficiently and it really helps in term of understanding out implementation and figuring out what goes right and wrong. 
2. I wish I could know more about the file system, virtual file system and virtual memory to understand how they are implemented and behaved in OS161.
3. The biggest difficulty that I encountered working in this project is being able to understand the already implemented features of OS161. In order to work on the syscalls implementation, I had to read through many different files, tried to figure out what features are relevant and what are not, and decided on which functions to be used. Another difficulty is the design of the global process manager which function is to keep track and manage the processes. It is also chanllenging to understand the communication between the processes and the file system as we didn't really do any work on the file system itself.
